# ZipCaptions
**Free Speech-To-Text In Your Browser**

ZipCaptions is a platform that allows users to generate text from a given audio source, using only your web browser. Zip Captions has never been and never will be pay-to-play: we believe that accessibility needs to be freely available.

## Support
We accept monetary support through [Patreon](https://patreon.com/zipcaptions). Any contributions are put toward offsetting the operating costs (such as they are) or implementing new features. We operate without any formal financial backers or sponsorhips, and have no corporate backers in any form. This is an entirely community-supported endeavour.

We also welcome bug reports, feature requests, and conversation in our Discord server&mdash;the more feedback we get, the better the tool will be for everyone.

## Language Support
We currently support multiple languages, by navigating to the `Settings` page. 

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Anything from bug reports to feature enhancements to pull requests are welcomed and encouraged. If you have questions about using the application, we recommend visiting the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Swe2JeHnPc) and asking your questions there.

## Languages
ZipCaptions supports multiple languages to the best of our ability. If you notice a spelling or grammatical issue, feel free to adjust the text and submit a pull request (guidelines below). For additional language support, you are welcome to create a new translation file.

## Reporting Bugs
Before reporting a bug, please search for any open issues in the GitHub repository, and add your information there if one already exists. When creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible (e.g. the device being used, browser and version, etc). If you use ZipCaptions on more than one device, check if the problem is isolated to one or the other, or if it affects both. Consider answering the following questions:
* Can you reproduce the problem consistently, or does it come and go?
* Does the problem represent a change from something that used to work in the past?
* What do you expect to happen, and what actually happens when the bug appears?

## Suggesting Improvements
We welcome feature requests or suggestions for added functionality. There are a few guiding principles for ZipCaptions, to which features must adhere:

1. The application may not collect any personal information, or include 3rd party libraries which do so.
1. The feature must ensure that it adds to the accessibility first ethos of the platform. Designs must include accessibility features and allow all users easy access.
1. The feature must be able to be provided for zero cost (or as near zero as possible).
1. Functionality must be implemented in the client-side application wherever possible.
1. All new text must include the required translations to all language files included in the `assets/i18n` folder. Translations can be generated using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) translate AI.
